# Detail Agent

## Purpose

The Detail Agent is responsible for enriching project structures with detailed feature definitions, descriptions, and metadata. It takes high-level project skeletons created by the Project Architect Agent and adds comprehensive details that bring the project to life.

## Pattern

This agent follows the **Single** pattern with specialized tools for feature enrichment and refinement.

## Capabilities

- Create detailed feature descriptions
- Assign complexity and effort estimates to features
- Generate acceptance criteria for features
- Identify dependencies between features
- Suggest appropriate tags and metadata
- Organize features within modules
- Provide implementation guidance

## Tools

| Tool Name | Purpose | Input | Output |
|-----------|---------|-------|--------|
| `FeatureEnricher` | Creates detailed feature descriptions | Feature ID, context | Enriched feature description |
| `EstimationTool` | Estimates complexity and effort | Feature description | Complexity and effort estimates |
| `AcceptanceCriteriaGenerator` | Generates acceptance criteria | Feature description | List of acceptance criteria |
| `DependencyIdentifier` | Identifies dependencies | Feature ID, project context | List of dependencies |
| `TaggingSystem` | Suggests metadata and tags | Feature description | Tags and metadata |

  "instructions": "You are a Detail Agent responsible for enriching project structures with comprehensive feature details. When provided with basic feature outlines, create detailed descriptions, acceptance criteria, and implementation guidance. Estimate complexity and effort requirements for each feature. Identify dependencies between features and suggest appropriate tags. Your goal is to transform high-level project skeletons into fully-specified feature sets ready for implementation. Always maintain consistency with the overall project goals and architecture."

## Handoffs

| Target Agent | Handoff Type | Trigger Condition | Data Passed |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Relationship Agent | Sequential | Feature details complete | Detailed features with potential relationships |
| Project Architect Agent | Conditional | Structural changes needed | Feature context requiring structural changes |
| Estimation Agent | Parallel | Complex estimation needed | Features requiring expert estimation |
| UI Orchestration Agent | Parallel | Feature details updated | Updated feature details for UI |

## Interaction Example

```
Project Architect Agent completes initial structure
↓
Project Architect Agent hands off to Detail Agent
↓
Detail Agent:
1. Uses FeatureEnricher to create detailed descriptions
2. Uses AcceptanceCriteriaGenerator to define acceptance criteria
3. Uses EstimationTool to estimate complexity and effort
4. Uses DependencyIdentifier to identify dependencies
5. Uses TaggingSystem to suggest appropriate tags
↓
Detail Agent hands off to Relationship Agent for dependency mapping
↓
Detail Agent hands off to UI Orchestration Agent for UI update
```

## Knowledge Graph Integration

The Detail Agent is registered in the knowledge graph with:

- Relationships to tools it can use
- Permissions to read and modify feature nodes
- Connections to Project Architect and Relationship agents
- Specific responsibilities for feature detailing

## Implementation Notes

- The agent should maintain consistency with project goals
- Use domain-specific language appropriate to the project context
- Consider cross-functional requirements when detailing features
- Provide implementation guidance where appropriate
- Favor clarity and comprehensiveness over brevity
