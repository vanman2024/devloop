# Devloop Integration

This directory contains integration code with the broader Devloop system.

## Purpose

This integration layer connects our SDK-based agents with the rest of the Devloop system, including UI, API, and other components. It ensures that our new architecture works seamlessly with existing Devloop infrastructure.

## Implementation

Coming soon: Implementation of integration points between the SDK-based agents and Devloop system.

Components will include:
- Event system integration
- API endpoint integration
- UI integration
- System health hooks
- Logging and monitoring

## Usage

Documentation on usage patterns will be provided as implementations are completed.
