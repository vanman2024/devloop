# RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

This directory contains implementation of RAG capabilities for Devloop agents.

## Purpose

Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM responses by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base. This implementation provides RAG capabilities for Devloop agents using our SDK-first architecture.

## Implementation

Coming soon: Implementation of RAG with the OpenAI SDK.

Components will include:
- Document loaders
- Text chunking strategies
- Embedding generation
- Vector storage integration
- Retrieval mechanisms
- RAG chains

## Usage

Documentation on usage patterns will be provided as implementations are completed.
