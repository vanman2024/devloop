# LangChain Integration

This directory contains integration code between the Devloop agent system and LangChain.

## Purpose

LangChain provides powerful abstractions and tools for working with language models. This integration allows our SDK-based agents to leverage LangChain's capabilities while maintaining our hexagonal architecture.

## Implementation

Coming soon: Implementation of LangChain integration with the OpenAI SDK.

Components will include:
- Chain integrations
- LangChain memory integration
- Agent executors
- Custom callbacks

## Usage

Documentation on usage patterns will be provided as implementations are completed.
