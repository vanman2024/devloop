# Feature Creation Agent Knowledge Graph Integration

This document explains how the Feature Creation Agent integrates with the Devloop Knowledge Graph.

## Overview

The Feature Creation Agent creates and categorizes new features, integrating them into the knowledge graph with rich semantic information. This integration includes:

1. Enhanced feature properties (requirements, priority, user stories, etc.)
2. Semantic connections to related nodes (domains, concepts, project structure)
3. Tag management to prevent tag proliferation

## Knowledge Graph Integration

The integration is handled by the `knowledge_graph_connector.py` module, which provides:

- A unified interface for adding features to the knowledge graph
- Automatic creation of missing hierarchy components
- Rich semantic relationships between features and related concepts

## Enhanced Feature Properties

The enhanced feature schema includes:

| Property | Description | Type |
|----------|-------------|------|
| `name` | Feature name | String |
| `description` | Feature description | String |
| `status` | Feature status | String |
| `tags` | Feature tags | Array of Strings |
| `domain` | Feature domain | String |
| `purpose` | Feature purpose | String |
| `requirements` | Extracted requirements | Array of Strings |
| `user_stories` | User stories | Array of Strings |
| `priority` | Feature priority | String (high/medium/low) |
| `effort_estimate` | Estimated effort | String (high/medium/low) |
| `risk_level` | Implementation risk | String (high/medium/low) |
| `test_coverage` | Required test coverage | Number (0-100) |
| `version` | Target version | String |
| `stakeholders` | Interested parties | Array of Strings |

## Semantic Relationships

The agent creates the following relationships in the knowledge graph:

1. **Hierarchical Relationships**:
   - Feature belongs to Module (`module_contains_feature`)
   - Module belongs to Phase (`phase_contains_module`)
   - Phase belongs to Milestone (`milestone_contains_phase`)

2. **Semantic Relationships**:
   - Feature related to Concept (`feature_related_to_concept`)
   - Feature belongs to Domain (`feature_belongs_to_domain`)
   - Feature has Purpose (`feature_has_purpose`)
   - Feature depends on other Features (`feature_depends_on`)

## Schema Migration

To update the knowledge graph to support enhanced features, use the `migrate_knowledge_graph.py` script:

```bash
python -m agents.planning.feature_creation.migrate_knowledge_graph
```

This script:
1. Creates a backup of the current knowledge graph
2. Updates the schema to support enhanced features
3. Migrates existing features to include enhanced properties by generating:
   - Requirements from descriptions
   - User stories based on domain
   - Priority based on purpose
   - Default values for other enhanced fields

## Tag Management

To prevent tag proliferation, the system includes a tag management module (`tag_management.py`) that:

1. Normalizes tags (removing special characters, standardizing case)
2. Deduplicates similar tags using string similarity
3. Caches known tags for reuse
4. Groups tags by domain for better organization

## Working with Features

### Adding a Feature

```python
from knowledge_graph_connector import get_knowledge_graph_connector

# Get the connector
kg_connector = get_knowledge_graph_connector()

# Add a feature
success, message = kg_connector.add_feature({
    'id': 'feature-123',
    'name': 'Enhanced Reporting',
    'description': 'Add enhanced reporting capabilities',
    'milestone': 'milestone-ui-dashboard',
    'phase': 'phase-04',
    'module': 'feature-improvements',
    'tags': ['reporting', 'ui', 'dashboard'],
    'domain': 'ui',
    'purpose': 'enhancement',
    'requirements': [
        'Reports should be exportable to PDF',
        'Reports should include data visualization'
    ],
    'priority': 'high'
})
```

### Querying Features

```python
# Query features by domain
ui_features = kg_connector.query_features(domain='ui', limit=10)

# Get features related to a specific feature
related = kg_connector.get_related_features('feature-123')
```

## Implementation Files

- **knowledge_graph_connector.py**: Main connector for interacting with the knowledge graph
- **migrate_knowledge_graph.py**: Script to migrate update the schema and migrate existing features
- **tag_management.py**: Tag normalization and deduplication system
- **enhanced_core.py**: Main agent implementation with knowledge graph integration

## Feature Creation Process

When the agent processes a feature creation request, it:

1. Analyzes the feature description to extract concepts, domain, and purpose
2. Queries the knowledge graph for related information
3. Suggests optimal placement within the project structure
4. Generates requirements from the description
5. Creates user stories based on domain
6. Determines priority based on purpose
7. Adds the feature to the knowledge graph with all enhanced properties
8. Creates semantic connections to related concepts and project structure

The enhanced feature properties provide a more comprehensive view of features in the knowledge graph, enabling better project management, feature tracking, and relationship discovery.
