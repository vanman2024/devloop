# Feature Creation Agent

## Purpose

The Feature Creation Agent is a specialized AI assistant that helps users create well-structured features with appropriate placement within the project hierarchy. It analyzes feature descriptions, integrates with the knowledge graph, and leverages project structure data to suggest optimal feature placement, dependencies, and metadata.

## Pattern

This agent follows the **Single** pattern with dedicated integration to both the Knowledge Graph and project structure database. It acts as an intelligent assistant during the feature creation process.

## Capabilities

- Analyze natural language feature descriptions to extract key concepts
- Determine appropriate milestone, phase, and module placement
- Generate feature IDs following project conventions
- Suggest relevant tags and metadata
- Identify potential dependencies based on feature context
- Create comprehensive feature definitions
- Provide guidance on feature structure and organization

## Tools

| Tool Name | Purpose | Input | Output |
|-----------|---------|-------|--------|
| `FeatureAnalyzer` | Analyzes feature descriptions for key concepts | Feature description text | Extracted concepts, domain, purpose |
| `PlacementSuggester` | Determines optimal placement in project structure | Feature concepts, project structure | Suggested milestone, phase, module |
| `IDGenerator` | Generates appropriate feature IDs | Feature name, project conventions | Conforming feature ID |
| `KnowledgeGraphQuerier` | Queries the knowledge graph for related concepts | Feature description | Related features, domains, dependencies |
| `StructureQuerier` | Queries the project structure for organization | Project ID | Current structure hierarchy |

  "instructions": "You are a Feature Creation Agent that helps users create well-structured features with proper placement in the project hierarchy. When a user describes a feature, analyze the description to extract key concepts and purpose. Query the knowledge graph to understand related domains and features. Use the project structure information to suggest appropriate placement within milestones, phases, and modules. Generate feature IDs following project conventions. Provide comprehensive feature definitions including placement, tags, and potential dependencies. Your goal is to simplify the feature creation process through intelligent suggestions while maintaining project consistency."

## Handoffs

| Target Agent | Handoff Type | Trigger Condition | Data Passed |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Detail Agent | Sequential | Initial feature created | New feature data for enrichment |
| Relationship Agent | Conditional | Potential dependencies detected | Feature with dependency list |
| Project Architect Agent | Conditional | New module or phase needed | Structure modification request |
| UI Orchestration Agent | Parallel | Feature creation complete | New feature data for UI update |

## Interaction Example

```
User describes feature in Feature Creator component
↓
UI passes request to Feature Creation Agent
↓
Feature Creation Agent:
1. Uses FeatureAnalyzer to extract key concepts from description
2. Uses KnowledgeGraphQuerier to find related concepts and domains
3. Uses StructureQuerier to retrieve current project structure
4. Uses PlacementSuggester to determine optimal placement
5. Uses IDGenerator to generate conforming feature ID
6. Creates comprehensive feature definition
↓
Feature Creation Agent provides suggestions to UI
↓
User reviews and confirms (with optional modifications)
↓
Feature Creation Agent handoff to Detail Agent for enrichment
```

## Knowledge Graph Integration

The Feature Creation Agent integrates with the knowledge graph by:

- Querying related concepts, domains, and features
- Understanding structural relationships between components
- Learning from past feature placements and patterns
- Identifying domain-specific terminology and conventions
- Discovering potential dependencies based on semantic relationships

## Implementation Notes

- The agent should prioritize user-provided information when available
- Balance AI-suggested placements with user preferences
- Maintain consistency with existing project organization
- Use project-specific terminology and naming conventions
- Provide clear explanations for placement suggestions
- Cache frequently accessed structure information for performance
