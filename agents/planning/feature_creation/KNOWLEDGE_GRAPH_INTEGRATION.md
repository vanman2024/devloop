# Knowledge Graph Integration for Feature Creation Agent

This document provides detailed technical information about the knowledge graph integration for the Enhanced Feature Creation Agent.

## Overview

The knowledge graph integration enables rich semantic understanding of features, their relationships, and their placement within the project structure. It goes beyond simple hierarchical organization by creating a network of interconnected nodes that capture the meaning and relationships between project components.

## Knowledge Graph Structure

### Node Types

| Node Type  | Description | Properties |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| `feature`  | Individual feature | name, description, tags, status, domain, purpose, created_at, updated_at |
| `milestone` | High-level project milestone | name, status |
| `phase`    | Development phase within a milestone | name, status |
| `module`   | Functional module within a phase | name, status |
| `concept`  | Tag-based concept node | name, domain |
| `domain`   | Feature domain classification | name, description |
| `purpose`  | Feature purpose classification | name, description |

### Edge Types

| Edge Type | Source → Target | Description | Properties |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|------------|
| `milestone_contains_phase` | milestone → phase | Milestone contains phase | created_at |
| `phase_contains_module` | phase → module | Phase contains module | created_at |
| `module_contains_feature` | module → feature | Module contains feature | created_at |
| `phase_contains_feature` | phase → feature | Phase directly contains feature (if no module) | created_at |
| `milestone_contains_feature` | milestone → feature | Milestone directly contains feature (if no phase/module) | created_at |
| `feature_depends_on` | feature → feature | Feature depends on another feature | relationship, strength |
| `feature_related_to_concept` | feature → concept | Feature is related to a concept | created_at |
| `feature_belongs_to_domain` | feature → domain | Feature belongs to a domain | created_at |
| `feature_has_purpose` | feature → purpose | Feature has a specific purpose | created_at |

## Integration Process

When a feature is added to the knowledge graph:

1. **Structural Component Creation**
   - Check if the milestone, phase, and module exist
   - Create any missing structural components
   - Connect the components in the proper hierarchy

2. **Feature Node Creation**
   - Create the feature node with all properties and metadata
   - Ensure timestamps and proper categorization

3. **Structural Connection**
   - Connect the feature to its containing module (preferred)
   - If module doesn't exist, connect to phase
   - If phase doesn't exist, connect to milestone

4. **Dependency Management**
   - Add edges to dependencies with relationship attributes
   - Create placeholder nodes for missing dependencies

5. **Concept/Tag Integration**
   - Convert each tag to a concept node if it doesn't exist
   - Connect the feature to all relevant concept nodes

6. **Domain and Purpose Taxonomies**
   - Ensure domain and purpose taxonomy nodes exist
   - Connect the feature to the appropriate domain and purpose nodes

## Query Capabilities

The knowledge graph connector provides several methods for querying:

### `query_features`

Query for features based on specific criteria:

```python
features = kg_connector.query_features(
    domain="ui",
    purpose="enhancement",
    tags=["visualization"],
    milestone="milestone-ui-dashboard",
    phase="phase-04",
    module="feature-improvements",
    limit=10
)
```

### `get_related_features`

Find features related to a specific feature:

```python
related = kg_connector.get_related_features(
    feature_id="feature-1234",
    relation_types=["dependencies", "same_domain", "shared_concepts"],
    max_depth=2,
    limit=10
)
```

Returns a dictionary containing:
- `dependencies`: Features this feature depends on
- `dependents`: Features that depend on this feature
- `same_domain`: Features in the same domain
- `same_purpose`: Features with the same purpose
- `same_module`: Features in the same module
- `shared_concepts`: Features sharing concepts/tags

### `get_project_structure`

Get the full project structure:

```python
structure = kg_connector.get_project_structure()
```

Returns a hierarchical structure of milestones, phases, and modules.

### `query_by_concepts`

Find related components based on concepts:

```python
results = kg_connector.query_by_concepts(
    concepts=["visualization", "dashboard"],
    domain="ui",
    purpose="enhancement"
)
```

## Implementation Details

### MemoryKnowledgeGraph Mock

The system includes a mock implementation of `MemoryKnowledgeGraph` for when the real knowledge graph system isn't available. This ensures the agent can work in standalone mode.

Key methods in the mock:
- `add_node`: Add a node to the graph
- `add_edge`: Add an edge to the graph
- `get_node`: Retrieve a node by ID
- `get_nodes_by_type`: Get all nodes of a specific type
- `get_connected_nodes`: Get nodes connected to a specific node

### Knowledge Graph Connector

The `KnowledgeGraphConnector` class provides a specialized interface for the Feature Creation Agent to interact with the knowledge graph. It adds:

- Feature-specific operations (`add_feature`, `query_features`, etc.)
- Project structure retrieval
- Concept-based queries
- Related feature discovery

## Example Usage

```python
# Get the knowledge graph connector
kg_connector = get_knowledge_graph_connector()

# Add a feature to the knowledge graph
success, feature_id = kg_connector.add_feature({
    'id': 'feature-1234',
    'name': 'Knowledge Graph Visualization',
    'description': 'Interactive visualization of the knowledge graph',
    'milestone': 'milestone-ui-dashboard',
    'phase': 'phase-04',
    'module': 'feature-improvements',
    'tags': ['ui', 'visualization', 'knowledge-graph', 'interactive'],
    'domain': 'ui',
    'purpose': 'enhancement',
    'dependencies': [
        {'id': 'feature-2101', 'name': 'Dynamic UI Components'}
    ]
})

# Get related features
related = kg_connector.get_related_features('feature-1234')
```

## Performance Considerations

1. The knowledge graph operations are not cached directly, but the results of queries are cached in the Enhanced Feature Creation Agent
2. When adding a feature, the system checks if nodes/edges already exist to avoid duplication
3. Indices are maintained for node types and edge types to speed up query operations
4. The mock implementation is optimized for memory efficiency rather than query performance

## Future Enhancements

1. **Graph Traversal Optimization**: Improve traversal algorithms for large graphs
2. **Semantic Similarity**: Add semantic similarity calculations between features
3. **Additional Relationship Types**: Support more types of relationships between features
4. **Visualization**: Add visualization capabilities for the knowledge graph
5. **Batch Operations**: Support batch addition of features for performance
