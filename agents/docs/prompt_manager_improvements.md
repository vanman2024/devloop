# Prompt Manager Improvements

## Redundancies and Issues Identified

1. **Token Estimation**: The `_estimate_tokens` method in `ContextItem` uses a very simple approach (dividing by 4). This could be replaced with a more accurate estimation function, especially since we have better token counting libraries available.

2. **Extract Relevant Context**: The implementation in `extract_relevant_context` is using basic keyword matching, which is noted in the comments as a simplification. This could be improved with an actual semantic search.

3. **OpenAIPromptManager Subclass**: This subclass provides minimal additional functionality and might be better implemented as utility functions or as a composition rather than inheritance.

4. **Error Handling**: Many methods have try-except blocks but some lack proper error handling or use different approaches to error handling.

5. **Context Pruning**: The `_prune_context` method could be optimized for performance and better prioritization of important context items.

6. **Class Responsibilities**: The `AdaptivePromptManager` class handles both prompt templates and conversation context, which might be better separated into two classes.

## Recommended Improvements

1. **Use Better Token Counting**:
   ```python
   def _estimate_tokens(self, text: str) -> int:
       """Estimate token count more accurately using tiktoken library."""
       try:
           import tiktoken
           encoding = tiktoken.get_encoding("cl100k_base")
           return len(encoding.encode(text))
       except ImportError:
           # Fallback to simple estimation if tiktoken not available
           return len(text) // 4
   ```

2. **Improve Context Relevance Extraction**:
   - Add support for actual semantic search using embeddings if available
   - Make the simple keyword matching more robust with better text processing

3. **Modularize the Architecture**:
   - Separate the `AdaptivePromptManager` into two components:
     - `TemplateManager` for handling templates
     - `ContextManager` for handling conversation context
   - Use composition to create a complete prompt management system

4. **Implement Provider-Specific Adapters**:
   - Instead of subclassing, create adapter classes for different LLM providers
   - This allows for better extensibility and separation of concerns

5. **Optimize Context Pruning**:
   - Implement smarter context window management
   - Consider semantic importance along with recency
   - Add support for summarization of older context

6. **Add Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Create unit tests for all components
   - Test with various template formats and edge cases

## Implementation Plan

1. Refactor token counting to use a proper tokenizer when available
2. Extract the context management functionality into a separate class
3. Implement providers as adapters rather than subclasses
4. Enhance the context pruning algorithm
5. Add proper semantic search for context extraction if embeddings are available
6. Create comprehensive test suite
