# Agentic Architecture Key Features

This document highlights the key features of the DevLoop agentic architecture, focusing on how the integration of specialized agents creates a powerful system for software development management.

## 1. Specialized Agents with Clear Responsibilities

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Feature Creation Agent"
        FCA1[Analyze Feature]
        FCA2[Suggest Placement]
        FCA3[Generate ID]
        FCA4[Create Feature Node]
    end
    
    subgraph "Task Agent"
        TA1[Extract Tasks]
        TA2[Analyze Dependencies]
        TA3[Create Task Nodes]
        TA4[Track Completion]
    end
    
    subgraph "Relationship Agent"
        RA1[Analyze Dependencies]
        RA2[Suggest Order]
        RA3[Detect Conflicts]
        RA4[Track Dependency Status]
    end
```

## 2. Knowledge Graph as Single Source of Truth

```mermaid
graph TD
    KG((Knowledge Graph))
    
    KG --- MS[Milestones]
    KG --- PH[Phases]
    KG --- MD[Modules]
    KG --- FT[Features]
    KG --- TK[Tasks]
    
    MS --- PH
    PH --- MD
    MD --- FT
    FT --- TK
    
    FT --- DEP[Dependencies]
    TK --- TDEP[Task Dependencies]
```

## 3. Agent Communication Patterns

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant FCA as Feature Creation Agent
    participant TA as Task Agent
    participant RA as Relationship Agent
    participant KG as Knowledge Graph
    
    FCA->>KG: Create Feature
    KG-->>FCA: Feature ID
    FCA->>TA: Process Feature
    TA->>KG: Get Feature
    KG-->>TA: Feature Details
    TA->>TA: Generate Tasks
    TA->>KG: Create Tasks
    TA->>RA: Analyze Dependencies
    RA->>KG: Get Feature & Tasks
    KG-->>RA: Details
    RA->>RA: Analyze Relationships
    RA->>KG: Create Relationships
```

## 4. Unified Service Layer for UI Integration

```mermaid
graph TD
    UI[UI Components]
    FAS[Feature Agent Service]
    
    UI --> FAS
    
    FAS --> FCA[Feature Creation Agent]
    FAS --> TA[Task Agent]
    FAS --> RA[Relationship Agent]
    
    FCA --> KG[Knowledge Graph]
    TA --> KG
    RA --> KG
```

## 5. Fallback Mechanisms for Resilience

```mermaid
graph LR
    UI[UI Request]
    FAS[Feature Agent Service]
    PF[Primary Flow]
    FB[Fallback Flow]
    
    UI --> FAS
    FAS --> PF
    PF -- Success --> Result
    PF -- Failure --> FB
    FB --> Result
```

## 6. Event-Driven Architecture

```mermaid
graph LR
    Event[System Event]
    
    Event --> FCA[Feature Creation Agent]
    Event --> TA[Task Agent]
    Event --> RA[Relationship Agent]
    
    FCA --> KG[Knowledge Graph]
    TA --> KG
    RA --> KG
    
    KG --> Event
```

## 7. Extensible Design for Adding New Agents

```mermaid
graph TD
    AG_EX[Existing Agents]
    
    AG_EX --- FCA[Feature Creation Agent]
    AG_EX --- TA[Task Agent]
    AG_EX --- RA[Relationship Agent]
    
    AG_NEW[New Agents]
    
    AG_NEW --- DA[Documentation Agent]
    AG_NEW --- TE[Testing Agent]
    AG_NEW --- CR[Code Review Agent]
    AG_NEW --- PA[Planning Agent]
    
    FCA --> KG[Knowledge Graph]
    TA --> KG
    RA --> KG
    DA -.-> KG
    TE -.-> KG
    CR -.-> KG
    PA -.-> KG
```

## 8. Integrated UI Components for Agentic Interactions

```mermaid
graph TD
    UI_FC[Feature Creator]
    UI_TST[Task Management]
    UI_RD[Roadmap View]
    UI_DG[Dependency Graph]
    
    UI_FC --> FAS[Feature Agent Service]
    UI_TST --> FAS
    UI_RD --> FAS
    UI_DG --> FAS
    
    FAS --> AG[Agent Layer]
    AG --> KG[Knowledge Graph]
    KG --> AG
    AG --> FAS
    FAS --> UI_FC
    FAS --> UI_TST
    FAS --> UI_RD
    FAS --> UI_DG
```

## 9. Workflow Orchestration Across Agents

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant UI as UI Layer
    participant FAS as Feature Agent Service
    participant Agents as Agent Layer
    participant KG as Knowledge Graph
    
    User->>UI: Request Feature Creation
    UI->>FAS: Create Feature with Tasks
    
    FAS->>Agents: Feature Creation
    Agents->>KG: Create Feature
    KG-->>Agents: Feature ID
    
    FAS->>Agents: Task Generation
    Agents->>KG: Get Feature
    KG-->>Agents: Feature Details
    Agents->>KG: Create Tasks
    
    FAS->>Agents: Dependency Analysis
    Agents->>KG: Get Feature & Tasks
    KG-->>Agents: Details
    Agents->>KG: Create Dependencies
    
    KG-->>FAS: Combined Results
    FAS-->>UI: Feature, Tasks, Dependencies
    UI->>User: Success with Details
```

## 10. Cross-Agent Knowledge Sharing

```mermaid
graph TD
    AG_SHARED[Shared Knowledge]
    
    AG_SHARED --- D1[Feature Metadata]
    AG_SHARED --- D2[Project Structure]
    AG_SHARED --- D3[Task Metadata]
    AG_SHARED --- D4[Dependency Info]
    AG_SHARED --- D5[Analysis Results]
    
    FCA[Feature Creation Agent] --- AG_SHARED
    TA[Task Agent] --- AG_SHARED
    RA[Relationship Agent] --- AG_SHARED
    
    KG[Knowledge Graph] --- AG_SHARED
```

These diagrams illustrate the key features of the DevLoop agentic architecture, showing how the different components work together to create a cohesive, extensible system for software development management.
