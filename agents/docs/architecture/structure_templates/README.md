# SDK-First Structure Templates

This directory contains structure templates for the SDK-first architecture. These templates provide a standardized way to organize and manage components of the agent system.

## Purpose

These templates adapt Devloop's existing structure system to our new SDK-first architecture. They serve several purposes:

1. **Organization**: Provide a standardized way to organize SDK components, tools, and agents
2. **Documentation**: Define clear relationships between different components
3. **Planning**: Support roadmap planning for SDK architecture development
4. **Integration**: Enable integration with existing Devloop systems

## Templates

### SDK Project Structure Template

`sdk_project_structure_template.json` defines the overall structure of the SDK-first architecture project.

Key features:
- Complete milestone structure for the SDK Foundation Framework
- Hierarchical organization (milestones > phases > modules > features)
- Tool and agent integration points
- Maintenance packets for SDK-specific tasks

Usage:
- Reference for organizing new SDK components
- Template for creating new SDK-related milestones
- Guide for planning SDK architecture enhancements

### SDK Roadmap Structure Template

`sdk_roadmap_structure_template.json` provides a schema for a knowledge graph-based roadmap tailored to the SDK architecture.

Key features:
- Node types for milestones, phases, modules, features, tools, and agents
- Relationship definitions between components
- SDK-specific traversal paths for knowledge graph
- Visualization layouts for different views of the system

Usage:
- Schema for a knowledge graph of the SDK architecture
- Reference for modeling relationships between components
- Template for visualizing component dependencies

### SDK Milestone Template

`sdk_milestone_template.json` provides an example of a milestone template for SDK-first architecture development.

Key features:
- Comprehensive phase structure for an SDK milestone
- Detailed module and feature definitions
- Integration with tools and agents
- Clear implementation relationships

Usage:
- Starting point for creating new SDK milestones
- Reference for organizing SDK development tasks
- Template for planning SDK implementation work

## Integration with SDK Architecture

These templates integrate with other aspects of the SDK architecture:

1. **Tool Registry**: Tool definitions can align with registry metadata
2. **Agent System**: Agent relationships map to orchestration patterns
3. **Knowledge Base**: Structure templates provide organizational references for knowledge base documentation
4. **Dependency Management**: Relationship definitions help manage dependencies between components

## Usage

To use these templates:

1. Reference them when planning new SDK components
2. Adapt them when defining new agent or tool relationships
3. Use them to generate structured documentation
4. Integrate them with knowledge graph implementations

These templates should be treated as living documents that evolve with the SDK architecture. They can be extended and modified as needed to support new components and relationships.
