# Migration Plan: Legacy Agents to SDK-First Architecture

This document outlines our phased migration approach from the legacy agent architecture to our new SDK-first architecture using the OpenAI Assistants SDK. The plan emphasizes incremental adoption to minimize disruption while ensuring functionality is preserved.

> **UPDATE**: We have completed the initial implementation of our SDK-first architecture. See the [SDK Architecture Guide](sdk_architecture_guide.md) for details on the new implementation.

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks
1. **API Changes**: OpenAI API updates may introduce breaking changes
2. **Performance Issues**: SDK-based approach may have different performance characteristics
3. **Feature Gaps**: Some legacy functionality may not have direct SDK equivalents
4. **Integration Complexity**: Integrating with existing systems may be challenging

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Pin OpenAI SDK version during migration
2. Design architecture to encapsulate OpenAI API calls for easy updates
3. Maintain clean interfaces between components
4. Use adapter pattern to bridge between old and new systems
5. Implement feature flags for progressive rollout

## Success Criteria

The migration will be considered successful when:

1. All agent functionality is implemented using our SDK-first architecture
2. Performance meets or exceeds previous implementation
3. All tests pass with SDK-based implementation
4. Legacy agent code is properly archived in the recycle bin
5. Documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date
6. New agents can be created quickly using the SDK-first architecture

## Rollback Plan

If significant issues arise during migration:

1. Use the feature-by-feature migration approach to limit risk
2. Keep legacy implementations available in the recycle bin
3. Document specific issues encountered
4. Implement parallel systems approach if needed
