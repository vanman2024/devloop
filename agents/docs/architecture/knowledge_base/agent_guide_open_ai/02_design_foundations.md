# Agent Design Foundations

In its most fundamental form, an agent consists of three core components:

## 1. Model

The LLM powers the agent's reasoning and decision-making. Different models have different strengths and tradeoffs related to task complexity, latency, and cost.

**Guidelines for model selection:**
- Set up evaluations to establish a performance baseline
- Focus on meeting your accuracy target with the best models available
- Optimize for cost and latency by replacing larger models with smaller ones where possible

Not every task requires the most capable modelâ€”a simple retrieval or intent classification task may be handled by a smaller, faster model, while harder tasks like deciding whether to approve a refund may benefit from a more capable model.

## 2. Tools

Tools extend your agent's capabilities by using APIs from underlying applications or systems. Each tool should have a standardized definition, enabling flexible, many-to-many relationships between tools and agents.

**Types of Tools:**

1. **Data Tools**: Enable agents to retrieve context and information necessary for executing the workflow.
   - Examples: Query transaction databases, read PDF documents, search the web.

2. **Action Tools**: Enable agents to interact with systems to take actions.
   - Examples: Send emails, update a CRM record, hand-off a customer service ticket to a human.

3. **Orchestration Tools**: Agents themselves can serve as tools for other agents.
   - Examples: Refund agent, Research agent, Writing agent.

As the number of required tools increases, consider splitting tasks across multiple agents.

## 3. Instructions

High-quality instructions are essential for any LLM-powered app, but especially critical for agents. Clear instructions reduce ambiguity and improve agent decision-making, resulting in smoother workflow execution and fewer errors.

**Best practices for agent instructions:**

1. **Use existing documents**: When creating routines, use existing operating procedures, support scripts, or policy documents to create LLM-friendly routines.

2. **Prompt agents to break down tasks**: Providing smaller, clearer steps from dense resources helps minimize ambiguity and helps the model better follow instructions.

3. **Define clear actions**: Make sure every step in your routine corresponds to a specific action or output.

4. **Capture edge cases**: Real-world interactions often create decision points such as how to proceed when a user provides incomplete information or asks an unexpected question.

You can use advanced models to automatically generate instructions from existing documents.
