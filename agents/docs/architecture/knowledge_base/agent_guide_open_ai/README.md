## How to Use This Knowledge Base

This knowledge base is designed to be a reference as we build and refine our agent architecture. 

- **Conceptual Understanding**: Read through the main documentation files (01-05) to understand the key concepts and principles.
- **Implementation Reference**: Refer to the code examples when implementing specific patterns or components.
- **Best Practices**: Follow the guidance on when to use different patterns and how to implement guardrails effectively.

As we develop our agent system, we'll continue to update and expand this knowledge base with our own implementations, lessons learned, and additional patterns.
