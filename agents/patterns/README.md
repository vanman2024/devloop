# Agent Patterns

This directory contains implementation patterns for Devloop agents.

## Purpose

Agent patterns provide reusable templates and strategies for implementing different types of agents. These patterns help maintain consistency and best practices across different agent implementations.

## Patterns

Coming soon: Implementation of the following patterns:
- ReAct Pattern (Reasoning and Acting)
- Multi-Agent Collaboration
- Hierarchical Agent Organization
- Memory-Augmented Agents
- Tool-Augmented Agents

## Usage

Documentation on usage patterns will be provided as implementations are completed.
