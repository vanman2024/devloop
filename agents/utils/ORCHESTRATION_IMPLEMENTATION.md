# Agent Orchestration Implementation

This document provides an overview of the agent orchestration system implementation, which enables multiple specialized AI agents to work together seamlessly.

## Architecture Overview

The orchestration system follows a service-oriented architecture with these key components:

1. **Orchestration Service** (Python)
   - Core service responsible for managing agents and tasks
   - Supports both synchronous and asynchronous execution modes
   - Handles communication between agents
   - Integrates with the knowledge graph

2. **API Layer** (Node.js/Express)
   - RESTful interfaces for the UI to interact with the orchestration service
   - WebSocket support for real-time updates
   - Fallback mechanisms for offline operation

3. **UI Components** (React)
   - Enhanced chat interface for agent interactions
   - Visualization of agent activities
   - Support for suggested actions

4. **Knowledge Graph Integration**
   - Maintains relationships between agents, tasks, and features
   - Provides context for agent interactions

## Agent Orchestration Patterns

The system supports two primary patterns:

### Manager Pattern

In this pattern, a central manager agent coordinates the activities of specialized worker agents:

```
                  ┌─────────────┐
                  │   Manager   │
                  │    Agent    │
                  └──────┬──────┘
                         │
          ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
          │              │              │
          ▼              ▼              ▼
┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐
│   Worker    │  │   Worker    │  │   Worker    │
│   Agent 1   │  │   Agent 2   │  │   Agent 3   │
└─────────────┘  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘
```

### Decentralized Pattern

In this pattern, agents can directly pass tasks to one another:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│    Agent    │────▶│    Agent    │
│      1      │     │      2      │
└─────────────┘     └──────┬──────┘
                           │
                           ▼
                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │    Agent    │
                    │      3      │
                    └─────────────┘
```

## Provider Integration

The system supports multiple AI providers through a unified interface:

- **Anthropic Claude**: Multi-agent coordination with a manager agent
- **OpenAI**: Integration with Assistant API v2 for agent handoffs
- **Google (A2A)**: Support for Agent-to-Agent communication protocol

## Workflow System

Workflows define sequences of agent interactions:

```json
{
  "workflow_id": "feature_task_workflow",
  "name": "Feature Creation to Task Breakdown",
  "description": "Workflow for creating a feature and breaking it down into tasks",
  "agents": [
    {
      "agent_id": "feature_creation_agent",
      "name": "Feature Creation Agent",
      "agent_type": "PLANNING",
      "provider": "ANTHROPIC",
      "role": "INITIATOR"
    },
    {
      "agent_id": "task_agent",
      "name": "Task Agent",
      "agent_type": "PLANNING",
      "provider": "ANTHROPIC",
      "role": "WORKER"
    }
  ],
  "steps": [
    {
      "step_id": "feature_creation",
      "agent_id": "feature_creation_agent",
      "description": "Create a feature design based on user requirements",
      "input_mapping": {
        "user_request": "feature_description"
      },
      "output_mapping": {
        "feature": "created_feature"
      }
    },
    {
      "step_id": "task_breakdown",
      "agent_id": "task_agent",
      "description": "Break down the feature into actionable tasks",
      "input_mapping": {
        "created_feature": "feature_design"
      },
      "output_mapping": {
        "tasks": "task_list"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Key Features

### Task-based Execution

- Tasks represent discrete units of work
- Support for retries and error handling
- Multiple execution modes (synchronous/asynchronous)

### Conversation Management

- Maintains conversation history across agents
- Preserves context between interactions
- Supports handoff between specialized agents

### Knowledge Graph Integration

- Agents can read from and write to the knowledge graph
- Enables persistent memory across sessions
- Maintains relationships between entities

### Offline Fallbacks

- System can operate with reduced functionality when backend services are unavailable
- Provides appropriate feedback to users

### Provider Resilience

- Adapts to provider availability
- Graceful degradation when providers are unavailable

## Usage Example

The following JavaScript code demonstrates how to use the orchestration system from the frontend:

```javascript
import orchestrationService from '../services/agentOrchestrationService';

// Initialize a conversation
const conversation = await orchestrationService.initializeConversation(null, {
  featureId: 'feature-123',
  featureName: 'Real-time Collaboration'
});

// Process a message
const response = await orchestrationService.processMessage(
  conversation.conversation_id,
  "I need to create a feature for real-time editing with cursor sharing"
);

// Execute a workflow
const execution = await orchestrationService.executeWorkflow(
  'feature_task_workflow',
  conversation.conversation_id,
  {
    feature_description: "Real-time collaborative editing with cursor tracking",
    context: {
      domain: "collaboration",
      user_id: "user-123"
    }
  }
);

// Get workflow execution results
const results = await orchestrationService.getWorkflowExecutionStatus(
  execution.execution_id
);
```
