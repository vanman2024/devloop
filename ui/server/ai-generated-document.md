Here is the detailed plan for implementing the AI-powered document generation feature in the Devloop system:

```json
{
  "id": "ai-doc-gen",
  "name": "AI-Powered Document Generation System",
  "description": "An AI-powered system for automatically generating documents based on structured data and templates. The system will use large language models and prompt engineering to understand the structure and contents of different document types, extract the relevant data from databases and other sources, and generate natural language text to populate document templates. It will support a variety of common business document types and allow new templates to be easily added.",
  "tasks": [
    {"id": 1, "description": "Design document data model and template system", "estimated_hours": 8},
    {"id": 2, "description": "Implement document template designer UI", "estimated_hours": 20},
    {"id": 3, "description": "Integrate with databases and other data sources", "estimated_hours": 16}, 
    {"id": 4, "description": "Train AI models for data extraction and document generation", "estimated_hours": 40},
    {"id": 5, "description": "Implement API endpoints for document generation", "estimated_hours": 12},
    {"id": 6, "description": "Build document generation pipeline and scheduling system", "estimated_hours": 24},
    {"id": 7, "description": "Implement frontend UI for requesting and viewing generated documents", "estimated_hours": 16},
    {"id": 8, "description": "Add support for additional document types and templates", "estimated_hours": 16},
    {"id": 9, "description": "Optimize AI models and generation performance", "estimated_hours": 24},
    {"id": 10, "description": "Test end-to-end system and fix bugs", "estimated_hours": 16}
  ],
  "dependencies": [
    "Databases for storing document data and metadata",
    "Storage system for document templates", 
    "AI platform for training and deploying large language models",
    "Devloop API for exposing document generation capabilities"
  ]
}
