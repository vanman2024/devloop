# API Implementations in Devloop

## Core REST API Implementation

1. **Devloop REST API (`/system-core/scripts/devloop/devloop_rest_api.py`)**
   - Flask-based REST API
   - Provides endpoints for:
     - Project status
     - Milestone management
     - Feature management
     - Feature execution
     - Status updates
     - Reports generation
     - Dashboard data
     - AI document generation
   - Launched via `/system-core/scripts/devloop/launch-api-server.sh`
   - Default port: 8080

## Component Removal API System

1. **Component Removal API (`/system-core/scripts/devloop/component_removal_api.py`)**
   - Core library for component removal operations
   - Provides functions for:
     - Analyzing removal impact
     - Removing milestones, phases, modules, and features
     - Managing backups of removed components
     - Updating UI roadmap
   
2. **UI Component Removal Bridge (`/system-core/scripts/devloop/ui_component_removal_bridge.py`)**
   - Flask-based REST API for component removal
   - Interfaces with the Component Removal API
   - Provides endpoints for:
     - Analyzing removal impact
     - Safely removing components
     - Listing available backups
     - Bulk removal operations
   - Launched via `/system-core/scripts/devloop/launch-component-removal-api.sh`
   - Default port: 5000

## Core API Layer

1. **Devloop API (`/system-core/scripts/devloop/devloop_api.py`)**
   - Consolidated Python wrapper for Devloop operations
   - Abstracts shell scripts and file system operations
   - Core API functions:
     - Project status retrieval
     - Milestone and feature management
     - Feature execution
     - Report generation
     - Dashboard data access
   - Designed as a bridge toward a future database-backed implementation

## Diagnostic Servers

1. **Diagnostic Server (`/mnt/c/Users/angel/Devloop/diagnose-server.js`)**
   - Express.js server for document generation testing
   - Provides:
     - Health check endpoint
     - System information endpoint
     - Mock document generation endpoint
   - Default port: 3000

2. **Demo Server (`/mnt/c/Users/angel/Devloop/archived_ui_system/old_servers/demo-server.js`)**
   - Simple HTTP server for the Devloop UI demo
   - Optimized for WSL with automatic browser opening
   - Default port: 3030

## API Integration

The API systems are designed to work together, with:
- Devloop API (`devloop_api.py`) providing core functionality
- REST API (`devloop_rest_api.py`) exposing this functionality over HTTP
- Component Removal API and Bridge for safe component management
- Diagnostic and demo servers for testing and demonstration

The APIs appear to be designed with eventual database integration in mind, currently using file-based storage but structured to allow future enhancement with proper database backends.
