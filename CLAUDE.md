- When examining and modifying or building any new code in the codebases:

  1. First understand the codebase overall thoroughly before making any changes
  2. Identify what's already implemented vs. what's missing
  3. Make smaller, focused edits rather than large overwrites
  4. Check existing code style and patterns and follow them closely
  5. Prioritize enhancing existing functionality rather than rewriting it

- Development Best Practices:
  1. Incremental development: Start small, get it working, then expand
  2. Understanding existing code: Taking time to understand the existing system before making changes
  3. Clean integration: Ensuring new features integrate cleanly with existing code
  4. Avoiding premature optimization: Not building elaborate solutions before understanding the requirements

- use wsl paths when viewing screenshots
- we can't use jq in wsl don't use it 
- `./start-dev.sh` use that to start server again
