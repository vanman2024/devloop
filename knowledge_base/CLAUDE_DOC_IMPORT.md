# Claude Documentation Import System

This system allows you to automatically import documentation generated by Claude into your Document Management System with AI-driven tagging and categorization.

## Problem Solved

As you work with Claude CLI, it continuously generates valuable markdown documentation. This creates several challenges:

1. **Duplication**: Claude may recreate similar documentation multiple times
2. **Discoverability**: Documentation is scattered across the codebase
3. **Organization**: No consistent tagging or categorization 
4. **Context Loss**: Documents lack connection to related information

The import system solves these problems by:

1. Identifying Claude-generated markdown files
2. Processing them with AI-driven tagging
3. Importing them into the centralized Document Management System
4. Tracking imported files to avoid duplication

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Set your Anthropic API key:
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

2. Make sure the Document Management System is running:
   ```bash
   cd /mnt/c/Users/angel/devloop/ui
   npm run dev
   ```

### Running the Importer

Use the import script to find and import Claude-generated documentation:

```bash
./import-claude-docs.sh
```

This will:
1. Find markdown files that appear to be generated by Claude
2. Process them with AI-driven tagging
3. Import them into the Document Management System
4. Track which files have been imported to avoid duplicates

### Import Options

The script supports several options:

```bash
# Import all markdown files (not just Claude-generated)
./import-claude-docs.sh --all

# Force reimport of already imported files
./import-claude-docs.sh --force

# Limit to importing a specific number of files
./import-claude-docs.sh --limit 10

# Just update the tracker without importing
./import-claude-docs.sh --update-tracker
```

## How It Works

### 1. Finding Claude-Generated Documents

The system identifies Claude-generated documentation by looking for indicators such as:
- References to Claude or Anthropic
- Specific heading patterns
- Common Claude markdown structures
- Special symbols like ðŸ¤–

### 2. AI-Driven Tagging

Each document is processed with the AI tagging system which:
- Analyzes the content using Claude API
- Extracts key topics, domains, and concepts
- Generates relevant tags and categories
- Determines document type (tutorial, reference, etc.)
- Assesses technical complexity level

### 3. Importing to Document Manager

Documents are added to the knowledge base with:
- Original content preserved
- AI-generated tags applied
- Proper categorization
- Metadata for searching and filtering

### 4. Tracking for Deduplication

The system maintains a tracker file (`knowledge_base/imported_docs.json`) that:
- Records which files have been imported
- Stores file hashes to detect changes
- Prevents reimporting unchanged files
- Maintains import metadata

## Viewing Imported Documents

After importing, you can view all documents in the Document Manager UI:

1. Launch the UI:
   ```bash
   cd /mnt/c/Users/angel/devloop/ui
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to the Document Manager page

3. Filter by the "claude-generated" tag to see all imported Claude documentation

## Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All documentation in one searchable system
2. **Automatic Organization**: AI-driven tagging creates consistent categorization
3. **Avoiding Duplication**: The tracking system prevents redundant imports
4. **Enhanced Discoverability**: Tags and categories improve document findability
5. **Rich Context**: Connected documents through shared tags and relationships

## Advanced Usage

### Programmatic Access

You can also use the Knowledge API directly:

```python
from agents.utils.knowledge_api import knowledge_api

# Add a single document
result = knowledge_api.add_document(
    file_path='/path/to/claude_doc.md',
    tags=['claude-generated'],
    auto_tag=True
)

# Search for documents
docs = knowledge_api.search_documents(
    query='architecture',
    tags=['claude-generated']
)
```

### Customizing Recognition

You can modify the `CLAUDE_INDICATORS` list in `scripts/import_claude_docs.py` to add custom patterns for identifying Claude-generated content in your specific workflow.
