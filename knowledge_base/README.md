# DevLoop Knowledge Base

This knowledge base serves as the central repository for information related to our agent orchestration system. It provides structured documentation, references, and examples to guide the development process and maintain consistency.

## Structure

The knowledge base is organized into the following main sections:

```
knowledge_base/
├── providers/              # AI provider-specific information
│   ├── anthropic/          # Anthropic Claude documentation
│   ├── google/             # Google AI (including A2A protocol)
│   └── openai/             # OpenAI (GPT models, Assistants API)
├── architectures/          # Architectural patterns and approaches
│   ├── agentic/            # Agentic architecture principles
│   ├── orchestration/      # Agent orchestration patterns
│   └── rag/                # Retrieval-Augmented Generation
├── documents/              # PDF and other reference documents
└── integrations/           # Integration with existing systems
    ├── langchain/          # LangChain integration
    └── database/           # Database schema and queries
```

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Consistency**: All documentation should follow the same structure and formatting to ensure consistency.
2. **References**: Include links to original sources when documenting external tools or services.
3. **Examples**: Provide concrete examples for all implementation patterns.
4. **Updates**: Keep documentation in sync with implementation changes.

## Querying the Knowledge Base

The knowledge base can be queried using:

1. **Direct File Access**: Navigate to the relevant directory and file.
2. **Search Tool**: Use the integrated search functionality to find specific information.
3. **RAG System**: The Retrieval-Augmented Generation system can query this knowledge base to provide context-aware responses.

## Contributing

When adding to the knowledge base:

1. Place files in the appropriate directory.
2. Use clear, descriptive filenames.
3. Include a title and brief description at the top of each file.
4. Tag files with relevant keywords to improve searchability.
5. Ensure all code examples are tested and working.

## Provider-Specific Considerations

Each AI provider has unique strengths that our orchestration system leverages:

- **Anthropic Claude**: Long-context understanding, planning capabilities, nuanced reasoning
- **Google A2A**: Strong RAG capabilities, document understanding, structured knowledge
- **OpenAI**: Function calling, tool use, specialization for specific tasks

The knowledge base contains detailed information on how to best utilize each provider's strengths while maintaining a unified interface through our orchestration layer.
