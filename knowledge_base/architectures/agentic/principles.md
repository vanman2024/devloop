# Agentic Architecture Principles

## Overview

Agentic architecture is an approach to AI system design where specialized AI agents collaborate to solve complex problems. This document outlines the core principles that guide our implementation of agentic systems.

## Key Principles

### 1. Specialization

Agents should have well-defined roles and responsibilities. Each agent specializes in a particular domain or task type:

- **Planning Agents**: Responsible for breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps
- **Knowledge Agents**: Specialize in retrieving and synthesizing information
- **Execution Agents**: Focus on taking action based on plans and knowledge
- **Coordination Agents**: Manage the workflow and communication between other agents

### 2. Autonomous Decision Making

Agents should be able to make decisions within their domain of expertise without constant oversight. This includes:

- Determining when to request information from other agents
- Deciding when a task is complete or requires revision
- Adapting to new information or changing circumstances

### 3. Stateful Interaction

Unlike stateless LLM calls, agents maintain context and memory across interactions:

- **Short-term Memory**: Tracking the current conversation or task
- **Working Memory**: Maintaining relevant facts and context for the current task
- **Long-term Memory**: Storing knowledge in persistent storage (e.g., knowledge graphs)

### 4. Communication Protocols

Agents need standardized ways to communicate with each other:

- **Structured Messages**: Well-defined formats for requests, responses, and updates
- **Metadata**: Contextual information about message priority, origin, and purpose
- **Handoffs**: Clear protocols for transferring tasks between agents

### 5. Multi-provider Compatibility

The architecture should support agents powered by different AI providers:

- Abstract provider-specific details behind consistent interfaces
- Leverage the unique strengths of each provider
- Maintain fallback options when specific providers are unavailable

### 6. Knowledge Integration

Agents should integrate with knowledge stores and retrieval systems:

- **RAG Capabilities**: Enhancing responses with retrieved information
- **Knowledge Graph**: Updating and querying structured knowledge
- **Document Understanding**: Processing and reasoning over documents

### 7. Observable and Explainable

Agent activities should be transparent and understandable:

- **Logging**: Detailed records of agent decisions and actions
- **Reasoning Traces**: Explanations of how agents reached conclusions
- **Visualization**: Tools to see agent interactions and workflows

## Implementation Patterns

### Manager-Worker Pattern

A hierarchical approach where a manager agent coordinates worker agents:

```
                  ┌─────────────┐
                  │   Manager   │
                  │    Agent    │
                  └──────┬──────┘
                         │
          ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
          │              │              │
          ▼              ▼              ▼
┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐
│   Worker    │  │   Worker    │  │   Worker    │
│   Agent 1   │  │   Agent 2   │  │   Agent 3   │
└─────────────┘  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘
```

**Best for**: Complex tasks requiring multiple specialized skills, centralized tracking of progress.

### Peer-to-Peer Pattern

A decentralized approach where agents can directly interact with any other agent:

```
┌─────────────┐           ┌─────────────┐
│   Agent A   │◄─────────►│   Agent B   │
└─────┬───────┘           └─────┬───────┘
      │                         │
      │                         │
      ▼                         ▼
┌─────────────┐           ┌─────────────┐
│   Agent C   │◄─────────►│   Agent D   │
└─────────────┘           └─────────────┘
```

**Best for**: Collaborative problem-solving, emergent behavior, more dynamic workflows.

### Assembly Line Pattern

A sequential workflow where each agent performs its task and passes results to the next:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   Agent 1   │────►│   Agent 2   │────►│   Agent 3   │────►│   Agent 4   │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

**Best for**: Well-defined sequential processes, specialization at each step.

## Challenges and Considerations

### Coordination Overhead

More agents can mean more communication overhead. Design patterns should minimize unnecessary interactions while ensuring all agents have the information they need.

### Consistency and Coherence

Maintaining a coherent user experience across multiple agents requires careful design of handoffs and context preservation.

### Responsibility and Authority

Clear delineation of which agent is responsible for which decisions helps prevent conflicts and ensures accountability.

### Error Handling and Recovery

Agents should be designed to handle failures in other parts of the system, with retry mechanisms and graceful degradation.

## Reference Implementation

Our implementation follows these principles with a hybrid approach:

1. A top-level orchestration service that supports both manager-worker and peer-to-peer patterns
2. Provider-specific adapters that abstract away differences between AI services
3. A knowledge graph that serves as shared memory between agents
4. A workflow engine that can execute pre-defined agent collaboration patterns

See the `orchestration_service.py` implementation for details on how these principles are applied in practice.
